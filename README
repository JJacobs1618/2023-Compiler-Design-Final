# 2023 Compiler Design Final Project by John Jacobs

## Description

- Motivation: Produce a compiler that will accept input in syntactically correct TL13 language and retarget for C++ compilation. 
- Purpose: To gain hands-on experience in compiler design to more fully understand the process from human to machine code.
- Lessons Learned: Flex and Bison file creation, tokenizing techniques, memory management

## Usage

This project was created in a Linux-based environment running Ubuntu 22.04.1. For best results, please run in a similar environment.

Steps to Run:
1. Open a Terminal window from the location of the Makefile included and run make.
2. Use the following command without the quotations: "./compiler-final-proj < [FILE]" where [FILE] refers to the .txt files located in the folder. (Adding " > output.txt" to the command will output results to a text file in the same folder)

Expected Results: A C++-styled output file that should be fully compilable after removing the word "SUCCESS" at the end of the output.

## Future Ideas
 
Line and Character count, as well as outputting precise error locations for user debugging.
